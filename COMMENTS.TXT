GLOBAL INFO:
------------

  - Each SoundDevice has it's own:
     - detection procedure
     - replay procedure
     - init procedure
    The detection procedure first takes a look at the environment variables,
    and THEN performs a Hardware test.

  - Work started somewhere around October 1995 with a GUS version. A few
    Months later, an SB version followed (not the actual one, which uses a
    totally different mixing routine (about 2000% faster 8-] ).


FEATURES:
---------

  - Loads & play's _ALL_ existant MOD / WOW formats (15-31 instruments,
    1-32 Channels). (It doesn't load MTM modules though)
    Following tags are recognised:

    "M.K." : 4 channel Protracker, 8 channel MOD's Grave Composer (.WOW files)
    "M!K!" : Standard AMIGA ProTracker MOD, over 64 patterns
    "FLTx" : AMIGA StarTrekker 4,8 channel MOD
    "TDZx" : TakeTracker 1,2,3 channel MOD
    "xCHN" : FastTracker 2,6,8 channel, TakeTracker 5,7,9 channel MOD
    "yyCH" : FastTracker 10,12..32 channel, TakeTracker 11,13,15 channel MOD
    "OCTA" : OctaComposer, 8 channel MOD
    "CD81" : ATARI/FALCON, 8 channel tracker MOD
 (x or yy = nr of channels)

    !! Note that if the loader can't find any TAG it recognizes, it will
    !! calculate the nr of channels using an alternative method.

- The patterns are repacked (not compressed) to save heap memory.
    (this is especially useful w/ a GUS: ALL Mods will load with about 500Kb
    base Memory. On a SB, it just runs out of memory a bit slower ;-))

  - Unused patterns or samples will not be loaded in order to save HEAP & GUS
    DRAM memory.

  - "Intelligent" loader. Detects MOD w/ crushed ID's. (They will not syste-
    matically be loaded as 15-instrument MOD's (these MOD's doesn't have
    an ID), unlike most other players).

  - Nice & Powerful setup program.

  - Source code is about 437Kb big, GUS driver library included


BUGS/INCOHERENCES:
------------------

*) LOADER:

  - Some corrupt modules may not load correctly. Loader is as polyvalent as
    possible... Really corrupt MOD's may hang the player. If this occurs,
    pressing <ctrl>+<brk> will help in most cases (It never happened to me).
  - Pattern analysing could be completer.
  - Samples > 0FFF7h bytes are cut (on a SoundBlaster, not w/ GUS)
    ( You should not miss too much anyway... )

*) PLAYER:

  - GENERAL:
      - SOME EFFECTS aren't (correctly) implemented. (See Below)

- SB PLAYER:
      - Mixing routine needs to be sped up: it is rather slow...


"PROBLEMATIC" MODS:
-------------------

MODFILE  :   Problem & REASON(Simple guess):
----------   -------------------------------

- if you have a .MOD that sounds wrong, mail it to me...


RE-PACKED PATTERN-SCHEME:
-------------------------

  There are still 4 bytes/chn:

     - First  byte: note (1..60, 0 = no new note)
     - Second byte: Effect ($10/$1/$2/../$9/$A/$B/$C/$D/$E0/$E1/../$EF/$F)
     - Third  byte: Effect Argument ($0..$FF)
     - Fourth byte: Sample Nr.

  The patterns are repacked: the 2 most significant bits of the first byte
(Note) are never used, so they can be used for compression.

     - Bit 7 (MSB) set: effect & effect argument follow
     - Bit 6       set: Sample Nr follows

--==>>> This scheme has been modified since version 1.1 for octaves 1-8
