BUGS in MP:
-----------

** EFFECTS:
    - Vibrato FX is buggy...
    - Tone Portamento is buggy when glissando is on (?) (control removed yet)
    - Tremolo FX is not implemented
    - If effect $D occured (pattern break) with an argument <> 0 in the last
      pattern of the song, the repetition of the MOD might not be as
      expected (MP USES the argument yet! Maybe it shouldn't).
    - nested pattern loops are not supported but ignored as garbage...


** MISC:
    - Clicks in playback
    - MP is able to detect compressed MOD's (these have a header that reads
      "PP20"), but is unable to load them. This bug will not be fixed in
      future versions (this *IS* possible, but quite overkill for such a
      little proggy. Special code is needed, due to memory conflict in
      PASCAL real mode programming).
